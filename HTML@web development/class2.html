                 Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family
                 in the pilgrimage center of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency
                 (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu).
                 His father,Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque,
                 and his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife.
                 His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi.</li>

                <li><h4 style="background-color: blueviolet;">Career as a scientist</h4>
                This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai,
                Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.
                Abdul Kalam
                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
                Kalam became a member of the Defence Research & Development Service 
                and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career,
                he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, 
                and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
               Later, he joined the Indian National Committee for Space Research,
               working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.
               He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research
               Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of 
               the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.</li>
